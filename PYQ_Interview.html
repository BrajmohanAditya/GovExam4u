    <div class="question"> Name one reform of Banking sector and Explain.</div>
    <div class="answer">
    <h3>Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016</h3>
    <p>The IBC was introduced to address the growing problem of <strong>non-performing assets (NPAs)</strong> in the banking sector.
     Before the IBC, banks and financial institutions faced significant challenges in recovering loans from defaulting companies, 
     as the legal system was fragmented and inefficient.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of IBC:</h3>
    <h4>1. Time-Bound Resolution:</h4>
    <p>The IBC provides a structured framework for resolving insolvency within <strong>330 days</strong> (including litigation period).
     This is far more efficient than the earlier system where cases dragged on for years.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Creditor-Centric Process:</h4>
    <p>The creditor-centric process gives priority to creditors over the company’s owners (promoters) during insolvency proceedings.
    Creditors, through the CoC, decide how to handle the company’s insolvency to recover as much of their money as possible, 
    ensuring their interests are protected.</p>

    <h4>3. Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP):</h4>
    <p>This process enables financially distressed companies to either restructure their debts or liquidate assets to repay 
    creditors.</p>

    <h4>4. Shift in Borrower Accountability:</h4>
    <p>Defaulting promoters lose control over their companies during insolvency proceedings. This discourages willful defaults and 
    encourages financial discipline.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Ease of Doing Business:</h4>
    <p>IBC improved India’s ranking in the <strong>World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report</strong>, particularly in the 
      "Resolving Insolvency" parameter.</p>

    <div class="question">State the differences between Growth and Development.</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Growth refers to an increase in physical size, quantity, or output. It is quantitative and measurable (e.g., income, population, production). <br>
      Development refers to overall improvement in quality, efficiency, and functionality. It is both quantitative and qualitative, encompassing social, economic, and environmental aspects. <br>
      <strong>Example:</strong>
     <p><strong>Growth:</strong> A factory produces <strong>1,000 cars</strong> in 2023 and increases its production to <strong>1,500 cars</strong> in 2024. This is growth because the quantity increased.</p>
     <p><strong>Development:</strong> The same factory not only increases production but also improves its <strong>technology</strong>, ensures <strong>better working conditions</strong> for employees, reduces <strong>pollution</strong>, and starts using <strong>renewable energy</strong>. This is development because it improves quality and sustainability, not just quantity.</p>
