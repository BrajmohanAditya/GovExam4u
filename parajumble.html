<p class="question">
Q5)<br>
A) Further, the problem of fund availability is not just about accessing institutional credit but also about the availability of working capital.  <br><br>
B) The present government has placed great emphasis on micro, small, and medium enterprises and entrepreneurship as engines of growth.  <br><br>
C) One of the lesser-known constraints facing MSMEs is the significant delays in receiving payments from buyers, 
particularly public sector undertakings, despite laws mandating a 45-day window, resulting in an often unsustainable working capital cycle.  <br><br>
D) A designated authority from the MSME Ministry can then review this invoice data from the Information Utility (IU)
periodically and initiate a series of actions, starting with issuing a notice to the buyer and escalating to a disclosure on its website.  <br><br>
E) The Mudra and Start-up India initiatives are illustrative of its keenness to promote a million new enterprises.
Despite these efforts, credit growth to the MSME sector, particularly industries, is negative.  <br><br>
F) The current grievance redressal system does not recognize the power asymmetry between the buyer and the seller.
While it is theoretically possible for an MSME to take a defaulting buyer to arbitration or use the government’s facilitation route, the system remains inadequate.<br> <br> 
G) To address this, the MSME Committee proposed that all MSMEs mandatorily upload their invoices above, say, Rs. 1.0 crore, to an Information Utility.  <br><br>

<p class="question">
Q7)<br>
A. In the 1940s, as experts debated safety measures to reduce the soaring number of traffic accidents, some were concerned that designing safer roads or cars would merely cause riskier driving, the hypothesis was bandied about but never rigorously tested.<br><br>

B. In his thinking, any safety advantage of the new regulations was being offset which gave serious quantitative ammunition to the anti-regulation enthusiasm of the 1970s.<br><br>

C. How individuals change their behaviour in response to perceived risk has been of interest to psychologists, safety regulators, and economists for decades.<br><br>

D. But in 1975, University of Chicago economist Sam Peltzman hypothesized that 1960s-era federally mandated vehicle regulations such as seat belts were actually making the roads less safe because they encouraged so much reckless and careless driving.<br><br>
