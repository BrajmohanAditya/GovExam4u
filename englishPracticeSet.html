        <h4>Banking on Obfuscation: A Critique of Financial Jargon </h4>

<p>The lexicon of the banking industry is a labyrinthine tapestry, woven with arcane terms and convoluted phrases. It is a linguistic citadel, impregnable to the uninitiated, where transparency is sacrificed at the altar of opacity. This obfuscatory proclivity serves not only to bewilder the average depositor but also to mask the intricacies of financial transactions, often to the detriment of the consumer.</p>

<p>While precision in language is undoubtedly essential in any specialized field, the banking sector seems to have taken this principle to an extreme. Terms such as 'subprime mortgage', 'collateralized debt obligation', and 'credit default swap' have become commonplace in financial discourse. Yet, their meaning remains elusive to most, serving as a smokescreen for complex and often risky financial instruments.</p>

<p>This linguistic labyrinth is not merely an academic concern. It has far-reaching implications for financial literacy and consumer protection. When customers are unable to comprehend the terms and conditions of their financial products, informed decision-making becomes a chimera. The result is a populace susceptible to predatory lending practices and other forms of financial exploitation.</p>

<p>It is imperative that the banking industry recognizes its responsibility to communicate clearly and concisely. While it may be tempting to shroud financial products in an aura of complexity, such a strategy is ultimately counterproductive. By adopting a more transparent approach, banks can foster trust and build stronger relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>Moreover, financial regulators must play a crucial role in ensuring that the language used by the banking industry is accessible to the public. Mandatory plain language guidelines can help to demystify the world of finance and empower consumers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the banking industry's penchant for obfuscation is a disservice to its customers. It is time to dismantle the linguistic barriers that have been erected between banks and the public. By promoting financial literacy and adopting plain language principles, we can create a more equitable and transparent financial system.</p>

<h2>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h2>

<p>
With the arrival of February, the weather in the city changes, the nippy cold slowly disappears, making way for warmer summer days. Along with the warmth, dust and highly suspended particles in the air make the residents fall sick, usually chalked to 'weather change'. The reasons, however, are hidden in the remarkable transformation that the cityscape undergoes. Characterised by the vibrant blossoming of flowering trees such as the Tabebuia, Jacaranda, and Gulmohar, amidst this visual spectacle lies a pressing concern that demands attention - the environmental and health impacts of managing the resulting litter from deciduous trees. Deciduous trees like Tabebuia shed their leaves and flowers in abundance as part of their natural nutrient cycling processes.
</p>

<p>
The transition from verdant lanes to litter-strewn streets poses a significant and laborious challenge for residents and municipal authorities alike. The carpets of fallen leaves and flowers not only mar the aesthetic appeal of the city but also necessitate labour-intensive efforts to clear them away. Unfortunately, the prevailing practice of burning this organic debris not only exacerbates air pollution but also harms the very trees that contribute to the city's greenery. The municipal authorities have regulations that discourage litter burning, despite which, the easy management of leaf litter through burning persists. The leftover leaf litter clogs stormwater drains following the summer rains, exacerbating flooding issues. Moreover, in addition to leaves, residents must contend with the chore of sweeping up fallen flowers and seeds from trees such as Tabebuia, Pongamia, Mayflower, and Copper pod.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, our ancestors understood the importance of aligning household activities and cultural celebrations with the phases of trees. Festivals such as Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Bihu were observed in harmony with nature's cycles, emphasising the interdependence between humans and the environment, along with inculcating sustainable management efforts into cultural practices. Given these challenges, it is crucial to ______ our approach to urban forestry and tree management. One potential solution lies in the promotion of evergreen tree species as part of avenue tree plantations. Unlike their deciduous counterparts, evergreens offer the dual benefits of year-round greenery and minimal litter production. By prioritising the planting of such species, the city can strive towards becoming a truly "garden and evergreen city," minimising the need for extensive litter management efforts and mitigating the associated environmental impacts.

<h2>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h2>

<p>When I visited my grandmother at the undertakers, an hour or so before her funeral, I wondered, as her memories vanished, had she become a little less herself, a little less human? These end-of-life stages prick our imaginations. They confront us with some unsettling ideas. We don't like to face the possibility that irreversible biological processes in our bodies can snuff out the stunning light of our individual experience. Thus, we prefer to deny our bodies altogether and push away the dark tendrils of the world.</p>

<p>The trouble for us is that this story - that we aren't really our bodies but some special, separate 'thing' - has made a muddle of reality. Problems flow from the notion that we're split between a superior human half and the inferior, mortal body of an animal. In short, we've come to believe that our bodies and their feelings are a lesser kind of existence. But what if we're wrong? What if all parts of us, including our minds, are deeply biological and our physical experiences are far more meaningful and richer than we've been willing to accept?</p>

<p>As far as we know, early hunter-gatherer animist societies saw spirit everywhere. All life possessed a special, non-physical essence. In European classical thought, many also believed that every living thing had a soul. But souls were graded. Humans were thought to have a superior soul within a hierarchy. By the time of theologians such as the Italian Dominican friar and philosopher Thomas Aquinas, in the 13th century, this soulful view of life had retreated, leaving humans the only creature still in possession of an immortal soul. As beings with a unique soul, we were more than mere animals. Our lives were set on a path to salvation. Life was now a great chain of being, with only the angels and God above us.</p>

<p>But, as the Middle Ages came to a close in the 16th century, a fresh, apparently rational form of exceptionalism began to spread. The origins of this shift lie in the thinking of Dr RenÃ© Descartes, who gave the world a new version of dualism. Descartes argued that thought is so different from the physical, machine-like substance of the body that we should see humans as having two parts: the thoughtful mind and the thoughtless, physical body.</p>
