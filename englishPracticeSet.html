        <h4>Banking on Obfuscation: A Critique of Financial Jargon </h4>

<p>The lexicon of the banking industry is a labyrinthine tapestry, woven with arcane terms and convoluted phrases. It is a linguistic citadel, impregnable to the uninitiated, where transparency is sacrificed at the altar of opacity. This obfuscatory proclivity serves not only to bewilder the average depositor but also to mask the intricacies of financial transactions, often to the detriment of the consumer.</p>

<p>While precision in language is undoubtedly essential in any specialized field, the banking sector seems to have taken this principle to an extreme. Terms such as 'subprime mortgage', 'collateralized debt obligation', and 'credit default swap' have become commonplace in financial discourse. Yet, their meaning remains elusive to most, serving as a smokescreen for complex and often risky financial instruments.</p>

<p>This linguistic labyrinth is not merely an academic concern. It has far-reaching implications for financial literacy and consumer protection. When customers are unable to comprehend the terms and conditions of their financial products, informed decision-making becomes a chimera. The result is a populace susceptible to predatory lending practices and other forms of financial exploitation.</p>

<p>It is imperative that the banking industry recognizes its responsibility to communicate clearly and concisely. While it may be tempting to shroud financial products in an aura of complexity, such a strategy is ultimately counterproductive. By adopting a more transparent approach, banks can foster trust and build stronger relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>Moreover, financial regulators must play a crucial role in ensuring that the language used by the banking industry is accessible to the public. Mandatory plain language guidelines can help to demystify the world of finance and empower consumers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the banking industry's penchant for obfuscation is a disservice to its customers. It is time to dismantle the linguistic barriers that have been erected between banks and the public. By promoting financial literacy and adopting plain language principles, we can create a more equitable and transparent financial system.</p>

<h2>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h2>

<p>
With the arrival of February, the weather in the city changes, the nippy cold slowly disappears, making way for warmer summer days. Along with the warmth, dust and highly suspended particles in the air make the residents fall sick, usually chalked to 'weather change'. The reasons, however, are hidden in the remarkable transformation that the cityscape undergoes. Characterised by the vibrant blossoming of flowering trees such as the Tabebuia, Jacaranda, and Gulmohar, amidst this visual spectacle lies a pressing concern that demands attention - the environmental and health impacts of managing the resulting litter from deciduous trees. Deciduous trees like Tabebuia shed their leaves and flowers in abundance as part of their natural nutrient cycling processes.
</p>

<p>
The transition from verdant lanes to litter-strewn streets poses a significant and laborious challenge for residents and municipal authorities alike. The carpets of fallen leaves and flowers not only mar the aesthetic appeal of the city but also necessitate labour-intensive efforts to clear them away. Unfortunately, the prevailing practice of burning this organic debris not only exacerbates air pollution but also harms the very trees that contribute to the city's greenery. The municipal authorities have regulations that discourage litter burning, despite which, the easy management of leaf litter through burning persists. The leftover leaf litter clogs stormwater drains following the summer rains, exacerbating flooding issues. Moreover, in addition to leaves, residents must contend with the chore of sweeping up fallen flowers and seeds from trees such as Tabebuia, Pongamia, Mayflower, and Copper pod.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, our ancestors understood the importance of aligning household activities and cultural celebrations with the phases of trees. Festivals such as Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Bihu were observed in harmony with nature's cycles, emphasising the interdependence between humans and the environment, along with inculcating sustainable management efforts into cultural practices. Given these challenges, it is crucial to ______ our approach to urban forestry and tree management. One potential solution lies in the promotion of evergreen tree species as part of avenue tree plantations. Unlike their deciduous counterparts, evergreens offer the dual benefits of year-round greenery and minimal litter production. By prioritising the planting of such species, the city can strive towards becoming a truly "garden and evergreen city," minimising the need for extensive litter management efforts and mitigating the associated environmental impacts.

<h2>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h2>

<p>When I visited my grandmother at the undertakers, an hour or so before her funeral, I wondered, as her memories vanished, had she become a little less herself, a little less human? These end-of-life stages prick our imaginations. They confront us with some unsettling ideas. We don't like to face the possibility that irreversible biological processes in our bodies can snuff out the stunning light of our individual experience. Thus, we prefer to deny our bodies altogether and push away the dark tendrils of the world.</p>

<p>The trouble for us is that this story - that we aren't really our bodies but some special, separate 'thing' - has made a muddle of reality. Problems flow from the notion that we're split between a superior human half and the inferior, mortal body of an animal. In short, we've come to believe that our bodies and their feelings are a lesser kind of existence. But what if we're wrong? What if all parts of us, including our minds, are deeply biological and our physical experiences are far more meaningful and richer than we've been willing to accept?</p>

<p>As far as we know, early hunter-gatherer animist societies saw spirit everywhere. All life possessed a special, non-physical essence. In European classical thought, many also believed that every living thing had a soul. But souls were graded. Humans were thought to have a superior soul within a hierarchy. By the time of theologians such as the Italian Dominican friar and philosopher Thomas Aquinas, in the 13th century, this soulful view of life had retreated, leaving humans the only creature still in possession of an immortal soul. As beings with a unique soul, we were more than mere animals. Our lives were set on a path to salvation. Life was now a great chain of being, with only the angels and God above us.</p>

<p>But, as the Middle Ages came to a close in the 16th century, a fresh, apparently rational form of exceptionalism began to spread. The origins of this shift lie in the thinking of Dr René Descartes, who gave the world a new version of dualism. Descartes argued that thought is so different from the physical, machine-like substance of the body that we should see humans as having two parts: the thoughtful mind and the thoughtless, physical body.</p>

<h3>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h3>
When asked to state your greatest weakness, odds are that a part of you wants to be clever by sharing a strength in the guise of a weakness. For instance, you might be tempted to say your greatest weakness is being a perfectionist. After all, in our achievement-oriented society, perfectionism is viewed as a badge of honour. The term implies you have high standards and are willing to go the extra mile to get the job done. It has become synonymous with being hardworking, conscientious, detail-oriented, and productive. On the contrary, perfectionism has nothing to do with these qualities. At its core, perfectionism represents a compulsive need to appear perfect because anything short of perfection is deemed unacceptable. <br><br>

Contrary to popular belief, perfectionism can hinder job performance. Perfectionists can become so detail-oriented that tasks take an excessive amount of time to complete. I have worked with physicians who struggled to complete their notes in a timely fashion because they would go through them with a fine-tooth comb looking for spelling and grammatical errors. It is one thing to review your notes to make sure they are coherent and contain all pertinent information. It is another to fret over whether you should add a comma to a sentence. In addition, perfectionists are prone to procrastination. When assigned a task, they put immense pressure on themselves to be perfect. This only makes them vulnerable to high levels of anxiety and prone to avoiding the anxiety-provoking task. <br><br>

Furthermore, perfectionists have an aversion to failure. They may avoid challenging tasks that push them beyond their comfort zone and choose tasks they perceive as having a low likelihood of failure. This tendency can stifle their personal and professional development by depriving them of valuable learning experiences. In addition to negatively impacting job performance, perfectionism can take a toll on interpersonal dynamics. Perfectionists can be difficult to deal with because they project their lofty expectations onto others. They can also be hypercritical when others fail to meet them. Perfectionists also tend to have a high need for control which can manifest as a tendency to micromanage others. If you have ever worked for an overbearing boss who watched your every move, you can appreciate how disruptive this behaviour is to work culture and productivity.

<h3>Directions: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</h3>
The art of listening is gradually fading into obscurity. In an era dominated by digital distractions and constant connectivity, genuine, empathetic listening seems to be a dying skill. Instead of earnestly seeking to understand one another, we often approach conversations with the sole intention of formulating our next rebuttal or crafting a clever reply. True listening requires more than just hearing words; it demands a profound engagement with the speaker's thoughts and emotions. Unfortunately, our fast-paced lifestyles
and the prevalence of instant communication have led us to prioritize quick responses over thoughtful understanding. As a result, meaningful connections suffer, and the fabric of genuine human interaction unravels.
<br><br>
In our rush to express ourselves, we risk missing the nuances and subtleties that make communication rich and meaningful. The art of listening involves setting aside preconceived notions, suspending judgment, and immersing ourselves in the perspectives of others. It requires patience, empathy, and a genuine curiosity to
comprehend the depth of someone else's experiences. Moreover, the rise of social media platforms and the constant bombardment of information contribute to the diminishing art of listening. Conversations become battlegrounds for opposing views rather than opportunities for mutual understanding. To revive this dying
art, we must consciously cultivate the habit of active listening, valuing the narratives and perspectives that differ from our own. In a world drowning in noise, those who master the art of listening become beacons of connection, fostering genuine understanding and empathy.

          <b>The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br>
             [T]he idea of <b>craftsmanship</b> is not simply nostalgic. Crafts require distinct skills, an allround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an attitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The concept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.<br><br>

             Essentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management studies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. Craft skills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist.<br><br>

             The contrast between <b>artisanship</b> and <b>efficiency</b> first came to the fore in the 19th century when British manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed the “<b>American system</b>” using standardised parts. The worldwide success of the Singer sewing machine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own reaction, first in the form of the <b>Arts and Crafts movement</b> of the late 19th century, and then again in the <b>“small is beautiful”</b> movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as people become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry.<br><br>

             There are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the existence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to be of extra quality. The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their purchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to craftspeople to be mended, or recycled.<br><br>

             For workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative choices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the overall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers focus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite the <b>“agile” manifesto</b> in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. The pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise “<b>individuals and interactions over processes and tools</b>.” By bringing together experts from different teams, agile working is designed to improve creativity.<br><br>

             But the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. Demand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might get automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and services often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the advantage.<br><br>

             History also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft guilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants. They were also highly hierarchical with young men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could set up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them. Craft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don’t get too organised.
